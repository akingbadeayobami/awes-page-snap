# awes-page-snap
A single page cloning script

When you want to save a page using ctrl-s from your browswer. Your brower just saves what it finds on the first layer as it doesn't go it to files to check what id included in them so as to get them.

But this script basically goes into the page and tries to get all the assets it can find and also arrange them in an ordered manner.
